MineTweakerRecipeMaker
======================

v2.x Now with support for more than just crafting!

The one and only **MineTweakerRecipeMaker**!

This mod creates the .zs file on the server's side, that is why you need the mod on the server too (and need to be op).
(Although you can join a server that does not have the mod, you just won't be able to use it.)

This mod has no relation with MineTweaker itself, and MineTweaker is not a dependency. Although this mod is utterly useless without it :p

**Warning**, this mod is not idiot proof, but it tries to be. :p Please post bugreports, so we can make it more idiot proof!
